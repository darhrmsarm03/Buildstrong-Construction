## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/buildstrong-construction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd buildstrong-construction
   ```
3. **Open the Website**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the homepage.
   - Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., with VS Code Live Server or `python -m http.server`).
4. **Dependencies**:
   - No external libraries or frameworks are required. The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. **Customization**:
   - Update `style.css` to modify the design.
   - Edit `script.js` for additional interactivity.
   - Replace images in the `image/` folder or update paths in the HTML files.

## Usage
- The website is static and can be hosted on any web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a traditional web host).
- Ensure all files, including the `image/` folder, are uploaded to the server.
- The contact form requires a backend service (e.g., Formspree or a custom server) to handle submissions. Update `script.js` to integrate form handling.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

### Notes:
- Replace `https://github.com/your-username/buildstrong-construction` with the actual repository URL.
- If the other HTML files (`about.html`, `services.html`, etc.) exist, they are included in the file structure. If they don’t, you may want to note that they are placeholders or need to be created.
- The contact form functionality is assumed to require a backend, as the provided HTML only includes a frontend form.
- Let me know if you want to add specific details (e.g., technologies used, additional features, or deployment instructions), and I can refine the README further!
